# delayedflow 0.1

## Major changes

- Initial release with major functions `dfi_n()` and `find_bps()` and two datasets
- `baseflow()` function is used directly from `lfstat` package as implementation there is really fast
- so far no package dependencies, i.e. no addtional packages will be installed when `delayedflow` is used
- beta testing

### delayedflow 0.11

- adding function `find_nmax()` to derive a `nmax` value.
- change many paramter names to more meaningful terms (e.g. `bp_mingap`).
