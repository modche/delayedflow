\title{Calculation of DFI (or BFI) with block length n or 1:n}
\usage{
dfi_n(q, n = 5, add_zero = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{vector with streamflow series}

\item{n}{block length \code{n}. If \code{n} is a integer (vector of length one) a single
delayed flow separation is performed. If \code{n} is a vector (with length > 1)
multiple separations for all \code{n} values are calculated. To analyze later on the
DFI curve it is recommended that \code{n} starts at 1 and is a continuous vector (e.g. 1,2,3,.... 58, 59, 60).
But also variations like \code{n = c(1,5,10,15,30)} are possible.}

\item{add_zero}{logical, default is \code{TRUE}. If \code{TRUE}, \code{n=0} and \code{dfi=1} is added to
output data.frame. Note that the \code{DFI} of a separation with \code{n=0} is by definition \code{DFI = 1}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with two columns: \code{n} for block length and \code{dfi} with the \code{DFI(n)} values.
If \code{n} is a single integer the function returns a single integer (i.e. one \code{DFI(n)} value).
}
\description{
Common baseflow separation separates quick- and baseflow with a
block length of n = 5 with \code{baseflow(q_obs, n = 5)}. To generate multiple separations
for the DFI index \code{n} vary between 1 and \code{n_max} (e.g. 60, 90 or 120 days). To do this the
function could be used with a \code{n} as a vector instead of a single integer (e.g. \code{baseflow(q_obs, n = 1:60)})
Note, separation with \code{n=0} is not possible. The DFI of \code{n=1} is not 1 as due to the algorithm some
streamflow peaks are separated from delayed flow.
}
\examples{
# same as BFI calculation
dfi_n(q_obs, n = 5)

# 10 different separations based on various block length n
dfi_n(q_obs, n = 1:10)

# only specific block lengths are used
dfi_n(q_obs, n = c(1,5,10,30,60,90), add_zero = FALSE)
