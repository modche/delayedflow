```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(delayedflow)
q_obs <- q_data$q_obs
```


Now see how the DFI curve looks like:

```{r}
cdc <- dfi_n(q = q_obs, n = 1:120)

head(cdc)
tail(cdc)

plot(x = 0:120, y = cdc$dfi, 
	 type = "o", ylim = c(0,1),
	 ylab ="DFI", xlab = "Block length N (days)",
	 main = "Characteristic Delay Curve (CDC)")
```


## Finding breakpoints

```{r}
bps <- find_bp(dfi = cdc$dfi, 
			   n_bp = 3,
			   plotting = TRUE)
```

Looking at:

 - the breakpoint estimates, here 4, 20 and 65 days
 - output of the objective function
 - relative streamflow contributions between `filter_min`, the breakpoint(s) and `filter_max.`

```{r}
bps$breakpoints
bps$bias
bps$rel_contr
```
